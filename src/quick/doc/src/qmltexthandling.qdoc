\brief elements that accept and handle text input

\section1 Text Elements

\list
\li \l{Text}
\li \l{TextInput}
\li \l{TextEdit}
\endlist

\section1 Validators
\list
\li \l{IntValidator}
\li \l{DoubleValidator}
\li \l{RegExpValidator}
\endlist

\section1 Displaying Text in QML
QML provides several elements to display text onto the screen. The \l Text
element will display formatted text onto the screen, the \l TextEdit element
will place a multiline line edit onto the screen, and the \l TextInput will
place a single editable line field onto the screen.

To learn more about their specific features and properties, visit their
respective element documentation.

\section1 Validating Input Text
The \l {Validators}{validator} elements enforce the type and format of
\l TextInput objects.

\snippet doc/snippets/qml/texthandling.qml int validator
The validator elements bind to \c {TextInput}'s \c validator property.

\snippet doc/snippets/qml/texthandling.qml regexp validator
The regular expression in the snippet will only allow the inputted text to be
\c {fruit basket}.

Note that QML parses JavaScript regular expressions, while Qt's
\l {QRegExp} class' regular expressions are based on Perl regular expressions.
