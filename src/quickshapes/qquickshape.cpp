    \title Qt Quick Shapes QML Types
    \ingroup qmlmodules
    \brief Provides QML types for drawing stroked and filled shapes.

    To use the types in this module, import the module with the following line:

    \qml
    import QtQuick.Shapes
    \endqml

    Qt Quick Shapes provides tools for drawing arbitrary shapes in a Qt Quick scene.
    \l{Shape}{Shapes} can be constructed from basic building blocks like \l{PathLine}{lines} and
    \l{PathCubic}{curves} that define sub-shapes. The sub-shapes can then be filled with solid
    colors or gradients, and an outline stroke can be defined.

    Qt Quick Shapes also supports higher level path element types, such as \l{PathText}{text} and
    \l{PathSvg}{SVG path descriptions}. The currently supported element types is: PathMove,
    PathLine, PathQuad, PathCubic, PathArc, PathText and PathSvg.

    Qt Quick Shapes triangulates the shapes and renders the corresponding triangles on the GPU.
    Therefore, altering the control points of elements will lead to re-triangulation of the
    affected paths, at some performance cost. In addition, curves are flattened before they are
    rendered, so applying a very high scale to the shape may show artifacts where it is visible
    that the curves are represented by a sequence of smaller, straight lines.

    \note Qt Quick Shapes relies on multi-sampling for anti-aliasing. This can be enabled for the
    entire application or window using the corresponding settings in QSurfaceFormat. It can also
    be enabled for only the shape, by setting its \l{Item::layer.enabled}{layer.enabled} property to
    true and then adjusting the \l{Item::layer.samples}{layer.samples} property. In the latter case,
    multi-sampling will not be applied to the entire scene, but the shape will be rendered via an
    intermediate off-screen buffer.

    For further information, the \l{Qt Quick Examples - Shapes}{Shapes example} shows how to
    implement different types of shapes, fills and strokes.

    \brief Describes a Path and associated properties for stroking and filling.
    \since 5.10

    A \l Shape contains one or more ShapePath elements. At least one ShapePath is
    necessary in order to have a Shape output anything visible. A ShapePath
    itself is a \l Path with additional properties describing the stroking and
    filling parameters, such as the stroke width and color, the fill color or
    gradient, join and cap styles, and so on. As with ordinary \l Path objects,
    ShapePath also contains a list of path elements like \l PathMove, \l PathLine,
    \l PathCubic, \l PathQuad, \l PathArc, together with a starting position.

    Any property changes in these data sets will be bubble up and change the
    output of the Shape. This means that it is simple and easy to change, or
    even animate, the starting and ending position, control points, or any
    stroke or fill parameters using the usual QML bindings and animation types
    like NumberAnimation.

    In the following example the line join style changes automatically based on
    the value of joinStyleIndex:

    \qml
    ShapePath {
        strokeColor: "black"
        strokeWidth: 16
        fillColor: "transparent"
        capStyle: ShapePath.RoundCap

        property int joinStyleIndex: 0

        property variant styles: [
            ShapePath.BevelJoin,
            ShapePath.MiterJoin,
            ShapePath.RoundJoin
        ]

        joinStyle: styles[joinStyleIndex]

        startX: 30
        startY: 30
        PathLine { x: 100; y: 100 }
        PathLine { x: 30; y: 100 }
    }
    \endqml

    Once associated with a Shape, here is the output with a joinStyleIndex
    of 2 (ShapePath.RoundJoin):

    \brief Renders a path.
    \since 5.10

    Renders a path by triangulating geometry from a QPainterPath.

    This approach is different from rendering shapes via QQuickPaintedItem or
    the 2D Canvas because the path never gets rasterized in software.
    Therefore Shape is suitable for creating shapes spreading over larger
    areas of the screen, avoiding the performance penalty for texture uploads
    or framebuffer blits. In addition, the declarative API allows manipulating,
    binding to, and even animating the path element properties like starting
    and ending position, the control points, and so on.

    The types for specifying path elements are shared between \l PathView and
    Shape. However, not all Shape implementations support all path
    element types, while some may not make sense for PathView. Shape's
    currently supported subset is: PathMove, PathLine, PathQuad, PathCubic,
    PathArc, PathText and PathSvg.

    See \l Path for a detailed overview of the supported path elements.

    Like \l Item, Shape also allows any visual or non-visual objects to be
    declared as children. ShapePath objects are handled specially. This is
    useful since it allows adding visual items, like \l Rectangle or \l Image,
    and non-visual objects, like \l Timer directly as children of Shape.

    The following list summarizes the available Shape rendering approaches:

    \list

    \li When Qt Quick is running with the default, hardware-accelerated backend (RHI),
    the generic shape renderer will be used. This converts the shapes into triangles
    which are passed to the renderer.

    \li The \c software backend is fully supported. The path is rendered via
    QPainter::strokePath() and QPainter::fillPath() in this case.

    \li The OpenVG backend is not currently supported.

    \endlist

    When using Shape, it is important to be aware of potential performance
    implications:

    \list

    \li When the application is running with the generic, triangulation-based
    Shape implementation, the geometry generation happens entirely on the
    CPU. This is potentially expensive. Changing the set of path elements,
    changing the properties of these elements, or changing certain properties
    of the Shape itself all lead to retriangulation of the affected paths on
    every change. Therefore, applying animation to such properties can affect
    performance on less powerful systems.

    \li However, the data-driven, declarative nature of the Shape API often
    means better cacheability for the underlying CPU and GPU resources. A
    property change in one ShapePath will only lead to reprocessing the
    affected ShapePath, leaving other parts of the Shape unchanged. Therefore,
    a frequently changing property can still result in a lower overall system
    load than with imperative painting approaches (for example, QPainter).

    \li At the same time, attention must be paid to the number of Shape
    elements in the scene. The way such a Shape item is represented in
    the scene graph is different from an ordinary geometry-based item,
    and incurs a certain cost when it comes to OpenGL state changes.

    \li As a general rule, scenes should avoid using separate Shape items when
    it is not absolutely necessary. Prefer using one Shape item with multiple
    ShapePath elements over multiple Shape items.

    This property determines which path rendering backend is active.

    \value Shape.UnknownRenderer
           The renderer is unknown.

    \value Shape.GeometryRenderer
           The generic, driver independent solution for GPU rendering. Uses the same
           CPU-based triangulation approach as QPainter's OpenGL 2 paint
           engine. This is the default when the RHI-based Qt Quick scenegraph
           backend is in use.

    \value Shape.SoftwareRenderer
           Pure QPainter drawing using the raster paint engine. This is the
           default, and only, option when the Qt Quick scenegraph is running
           with the \c software backend.

    \value Shape.CurveRenderer
           Experimental GPU-based renderer, added as technology preview in Qt 6.6.
           In contrast to \c Shape.GeometryRenderer, curves are not approximated by short straight
           lines. Instead, curves are rendered using a specialized fragment shader. This improves
           visual quality and avoids re-tesselation performance hit when zooming. Also,
           \c Shape.CurveRenderer provides native, high-quality anti-aliasing, without the
           performance cost of multi- or supersampling.

    By default, \c Shape.GeometryRenderer will be selected unless the Qt Quick scenegraph is running
    with the \c software backend. In that case, \c Shape.SoftwareRenderer will be used.
    \c Shape.CurveRenderer may be requested using the \l preferredRendererType property.

    Note that \c Shape.CurveRenderer is currently regarded as experimental. The enum name of
    this renderer may change in future versions of Qt, and some shapes may render incorrectly.
    Among the known limitations are:
    \list 1
      \li Only quadratic curves are inherently supported. Cubic curves will be approximated by

        contains the given point. The more complex and numerous ShapePaths you

    One way to speed up the \c FillContains check is to generate an approximate
